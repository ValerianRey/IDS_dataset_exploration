Classic normalization (x - mean) / std
threshold computed on training set, half of the data in train set and half in test set

	No training (the only data from training set is the normalization and the threshold)
TPR: 0.9999 - TNR: 0.9595 - FPR: 0.0405 - FNR: 0.0001
For both problematic devices, the threshold is twice as low as the average loss for gafgyt tcp and udp.

	120 epochs training
TPR: 0.9395 - TNR: 0.9708 - FPR: 0.0292 - FNR: 0.0605
mainly because of 1002 and 1003 cams on gafgyt tcp and udp
For 1002 the threshold is 6 times too high to detect those attacks
for 1003 the threshold is like 20% too high to detect those attacks (maybe a little bit more training will entirely solve the problem)

	Mega training (max 500 epochs, stop when lr too low)
TPR: 0.8149 - TNR: 0.9677 - FPR: 0.0323 - FNR: 0.1851
